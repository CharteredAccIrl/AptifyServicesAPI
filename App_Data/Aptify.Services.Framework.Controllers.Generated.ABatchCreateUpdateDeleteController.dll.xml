            <summary>
            This endpoint is for batching multiple create update and delete entity requests into a single transaction.  The resource in this scenario is the batch request itself, since we need
            to safeguard against batches being replayed inadvertently.  Each batch is identified by a GUID, which is the resource identifier.  Batches can only be created, never deleted.  If a
            batch is resubmitted this service will respond with a 409 response code indicating a conflict.
            </summary>
            <param name="BatchGuid">The batch GUID to create.</param>
            <returns>
            Typically this service will always return a 200 response code, unless the batch is being replayed.  A 200 response code indicates that the batch was successfully created.  It does not
            mean that the batch was successfully applied.  Callers must look at the JSON response to determine which portions of the batch were successful.
